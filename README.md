# TypeScript Refresh Practice

This repository contains practice code and mini-projects completed to rebuild and solidify TypeScript fundamentals.

## Goals

- Refresh core TypeScript concepts (types, interfaces, generics, modules).  
- Practice writing **clean**, typed code in a realistic project structure.  
- Build confidence using TypeScript with modern tooling (Node, npm, ts-node, etc.).  


> This repo is primarily for learning and experimentation, not for production use.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript  
- Node.js  
- npm / yarn  
- ESLint / Prettier (for linting and formatting)
